# Football Data API Free Tier

This is the free tier of the football-data.org api, but I put it in a docker container so it can be deployed and used with as a backend that I can manage 
the data and do any extra data operations I may need for my website :)


To run enter the project directory and run `docker compose up` this should run the application which is then can be reached at:

`http://0.0.0.0:8000` 

Lastly, this API takes an `API_KEY`, so make a `.env` file inside the project and set it equal to your on API key.
